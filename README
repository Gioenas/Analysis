Data Cleaning work made on the existing
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0
==================================================================
By Giovanni Enas, gio.enas@ yahoo.com
==================================================================
The former experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
My duty was to merge the test and train databases, insert a couple of columns describing each of the subjects that took part to the experiment with a numeric value from 1 to 30.
In addition I added a text descirbing column for the 6 actions of the original experiment.
Later I had to subset the database for only the columns reporting the mean and std values.
I had also to format the features names to a more comprehensive text version.
I saved the resulting database in the home directory with the name of X_selected.
Right away I had to build a brand new database which reports the means and the std for each subject and each activity, also with a descriptive column.
I saved the resulting database in the home directory under the name of X_sorted.
==================================================================
The file run_analysis.R is a script that starts with 2 functions to be use later in the code
label_names is a function that takes as argument the numeric column activity and make a text column with the words of the six activities, namenly "walkin, walking_upstairs, walking_downstairs, sitting, standing and laying".
sort_activity is a function for filtering the original database, and perform the mean for each activity, leaving one activity for each row of each subject.
The script then reads the original databases, merges test and train, adds two more columns for subjects and activities, extracts all the label's names and re-format them in a proper way, then select only the columns of interest and write the first database to the working directory.
Next uses the described functions to select a new database, insert the new text column with the names of the activities and save to the working directory.
